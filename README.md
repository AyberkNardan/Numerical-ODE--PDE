# Numerical ODE & PDE
 This repository is created for my study notes on numerical analysis of differential equations under the math490 (a project course) course at Boğaziçi University. \
 These notes rely mainly on the [Iserles's book](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/mathematics/numerical-analysis/first-course-numerical-analysis-differential-equations-2nd-edition?format=PB).
